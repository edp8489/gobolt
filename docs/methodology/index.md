# gobolt Methodology Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides references for the equations and data tables used by `gobolt` to calculate various properties of threaded fasteners. In many cases, original source material is a photocopy of a typed document, and legibility is mediocre at best. Equations are reproduced here, as needed, for easier reference.
