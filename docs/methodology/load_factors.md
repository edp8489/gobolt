# Load Factors

## Separation Factor of Safety
TODO - Blog post link and comparison of two NASA doc recommendations

## Fitting Factor
A fitting factor of 1.15 shall be applied by default to all strength calculations. This is required for designs "...whose strength is not proven by limit and ultimate load tests in which actual stress conditions are simulated in the fitting and surrounding structures..." per FAA CFR 25.625 [^1].

## Prying Factor
Default ~ 1.5 - 2.0

TODO - Pay for reference. Look for for a thickness-based correlation

## Bearing Knockdowns
Various correction factors should be applied to published bearing strength data as detailed below.

### Wet Pin
Shall be applied when either A) hole diameter tolerances exceed  +/- .001 in, or B) fasteners have not undergone the special cleaning procedures specified in ASTM E238. [^2]

TODO - Values per https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2162&amp;context=theses

### Edgewise Bearing
Thick plate 2000 and 7000 series aluminum. Values per MIL-HDBK-5J / MMPDS-01 Table 3.1.2.1.1

### Countersunk Fasteners
TODO - Link to blog post
